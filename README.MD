## No longer maintained
This project is no longer being activly maintained and we do not reccomend its use anymore.

CyberWorks 3 is one of our many rewrites of CyberWorks to make it more usable. It was originally designed for [Critical Gaming](https://criticalgaming.org/) and we have since decided to open source it after removing the custom content. We __highly__ recommend you use this version and not our original CyberWorks as we intend to maintain this version.

If you are not using composer download it from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Cyberbyte-Studios/CyberWorks-3/releases/latest).

## Features
